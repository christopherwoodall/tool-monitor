AI Agent Architectural Patterns: Key Insights and Research Themes

1. Multi-Agent Architecture Design:
- Architecture selection depends on task complexity
- Agents can be structured with specialized roles (e.g., Planner-Executor pattern)
- Interaction patterns are crucial for effective multi-agent systems

2. Agent Component Characteristics:
- Executors can be simpler and more specialized than planners
- Different computational complexity across agent components
- Potential for using smaller, faster LLMs or deterministic components

3. Emerging Research Focus:
- Bridging performance gap with human capabilities
- Exploring patterns to automate complex tasks
- Addressing challenges like bias and alignment
- Developing more autonomous and adaptable LLM agents

4. Architectural Evaluation:
- Defining observable behaviors and components
- Creating metrics that link behavioral phenomena to architectural design
- Systematic approach to understanding agent performance

Conclusion: The field is rapidly evolving, with ongoing research aimed at creating more sophisticated, flexible, and efficient AI agent architectures.
